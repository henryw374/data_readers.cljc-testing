Demo of Clojurescript compilation problem with dot access such as js/foo.bar

the issue is tracked here: https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJS-3315 

# Usage

start a repl 

```clojure 

(require 'compile)
(compile/build)
```

that creates prod-target/main.js, which is just the compiled result of dot.dot-test 

eyeballing that file, you can see that instead of '"bar?" foo.bar', you see some mangled thing,
whereas `console.log("car? ",a.car,a.car)` comes out correctly.

There is also a `:shadow` alias. Starting a repl with that, `(require 'shadow-compile)`,
and execute (restart) and `(prod-build)` in that. That creates shadow/public/compiled/js/main.js
which has the same problem as the non-shadow build
